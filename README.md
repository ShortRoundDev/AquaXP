**AquaXP** is a lightweight framework for creating DX11 apps. It is intended to reduce some of the burden
of the C++ and infrastructure layers of an application, allowing developers to focus more on the HLSL
and rendering logic, but while still exposing DirectX objects so that the developer can take control
when needed. AquaXP is not a game engine, but rather a framework for creating applications that use
DirectX 11. AquaXP uses DirectX 11 under the hood, but may move to DirectX 12 later on to take
advantage of some of the multi-core rendering features like command lists.
